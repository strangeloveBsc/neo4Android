neo4Android
===========

Taking up the long and not-as-boring task of porting the NEO2-Layout to (rooted) Android devices
The goal is to support a generic 104-keys keyboard with NEO2 as seen on your computer.

Feel free to reuse and share, please report bugs via Github. I'm just a student wasting his free time so change will come
gradually.
I fear it's not possible to include all the fancy things NEO2 can do in this limited approach but let's see how far we get!
